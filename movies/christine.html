    <h1>Christine <small><a href="../">< Back</a></h1>
    <p>The shocking true story that changed the face of television.</p>
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>In Sarasota, FL, circa 1974, an ambitious, 29-year-old reporter is relentlessly motivated to succeed. She knows she has talent, but being a driven career woman in the '70s comes with its own challenges, especially when competition for a promotion and a tumultuous home life lead to a dissolution of self. With ratings in the cellar, the station manager issues a mandate to deliver juicier and more exploitative stories, a story firmly at odds with her serious brand of issue-based journalism. </p>

    <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>"[Christine] is a clinging, yearning look at one woman's <strong>mad desire for acceptance.</strong>" <i>- Kristen Lopez</i></p>
        <p>"With slow-burning, stomach-squeezing panic Rebecca Hall delivers a superb performance in Christine as the real-life American television reporter Christine Chubbuck." <i>- Kate Muir</i></p>
        <p>"[Christine] is based on true events, and I suspect it's all the more powerful if you don't know what happens at the end. I did, but the film still gripped me." <i>- Moira MacDonald</i></p>
