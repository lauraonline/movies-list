    <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>"Lady Bird combines wisdom and tenderness, humor and grace. It's light-footed without being lightweight. And it captures, with great feeling, the turbulence of a girl growing up. I can't recommend it enough." <i>- Anumama Chopra</i></p>
        <p>"It is a female coming-of-age story that is both nostalgic and unflinching, and it will ensnare you deeply in its grasp." <i>- Roxana Hadadi</i></p>
        <p>"As teen movies go, it's supremely sophisticated, capturing and crystallising that moment in adolescence when it seems that life is at last about to start and the only place you want to be is elsewhere." <i>- Sandra Hall</i></p>
