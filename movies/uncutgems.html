    <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>"The thing that elevates it above all else is the frenetic energy that infuses every scene, yet calibrated so perfectly so that it stays, barely, on the right side of frustrating. There's nothing more thrilling than that." <i>- Wenlei Ma, News.com.au</i></p>
        <p>"Uncut Gems is a fairytale written by the hand of capitalism, where mystical highs are followed by crushing blows -- and there's always a price to pay. " <i>- Clarisse Loughrey, Independent.co.uk</i></p>
        <p>"My only criticism is that the film takes a long time to play out. Even so, it's a movie that commands your attention & lingers afterwards, as does Sandler's intensely focused performance. This tops everything he's done before & is worthy of an Oscar." <i>- Leonard Maltin</i></p>
